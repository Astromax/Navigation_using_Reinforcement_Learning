# Navigation_using_Reinforcement_Learning
Solution to the Udacity DRL Navigation Project

#Project Overview
In this project we have an agent running around in a 2D environment filled with yellow & blue bananas.  The objective is to obtain as many yellow bananas, each worth +1, as possible, while avoiding the blue bananas, each worth -1.  The state space is a 37 element vector corresponding to rays spread out from the agent, it's deliberately left vague as to what exactly these rays are supposed to be physically but they appear to be like LIDAR, with beams sent forward at several different angles.  The action space is just the four directions of motion: forward, backward, left, right.  The environment is considered "solved" when the average score over 100 consecutive episodes is 13 or higher.

#Setup
This was done in the Udacity Workspace, but can be done locally on Windows, Mac, or Linux.  Follow these instructions from the program to do so.  FILL IN LATER

#Running the code
The central notebook is self-contained, if you have access to Udacity's Workspace then just run every cell in order and it will work.
